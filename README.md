# Decentralized Social Media - Blockchain
This project aims to create a decentralized social media platform using blockchain technology. Users will have enhanced control over their data privacy and content, while leveraging the benefits of blockchain's transparency and immutability. The project utilizes Next.js, Hardhat, and Sanity to build and deploy the application.

# Getting Started
To run the development server, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server on http://localhost:3000. You can modify the pages in the pages directory to customize the application.

API routes can be accessed at http://localhost:3000/api/hello. You can edit this endpoint in the pages/api/hello.js file.
